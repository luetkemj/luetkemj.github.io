I've been working on Scribe for 9 months now. I keep saying that this is a learning project and this is a good case in point. I have always known that flow charts are a thing you should do and yet I chose not to.

When yarn came out we audited it at work and ultimately decided that despite the hubbub surrounding its release we were not going to migrate to it. At the time it solved problems we did not have. Fast forward a few months and we encountered an interesting failure in our build due to a peer dependency incompatibility in one of our imported modules. If we had been using yarn we would have avoided the issue altogether. But if we had been using yarn all along we never would have seen its benefits. We use yarn now.

When I started Scribe I mentioned what I was working on to a colleague. He immediately recognized the scope of what I was proposing. I more or less ignored his concerns and declared it a learning project. He responded with something along the lines of ‚ÄúI know, I know, you like to experience the pain.‚Äù

The best way for me to learn is the hard way. I like to experience the pain. This is only way I can truly see the benefits of my toolkit and know which tool really belong there.

**This is all just a very long-winded way of saying that flow charts are good.**

Scribe plugged along merrily for some time without a clear direction. Certainly small features were focused but overall the plan was at best foggy.

Over the past week I have attempting to bring some clarity to the project. Being a designer at heart I immediately cracked open sketch and began to redesign everything. I quickly realized of course that moving directly into high fidelity designs did not bring clarity but instead more questions. The more detailed the designs more steps I found were missing. So I signed up for InVision and started working on a clickable demo. This was great until I showed it to another colleague with a heavy UX background. There were of course even more things I was missing. I was now faced with redesigning extremely high fidelity screens. No small task!

Finally, after experiencing much pain I relented and made a flow chart this weekend. It was enlightening to say the least. The scope creep in this diagram is dizzying. When your pages are reduced to a rectangles and your UX is reduced to arrows everything becomes so damn simple. I can make anything! And with that in mind here is my new floe for everything that happened before you even get the campaign in scribe.

Of course I expect to experience plenty of pain as I attempt to build this out. But at least I‚Äôll never start another project without a flow chart again.

I‚Äôll also never try and diagram in the kitchen again as my son is clearly mocking me üòÄ
