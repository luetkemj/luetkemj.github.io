Finally got a monitor for the raspberry pi. Spent the evening getting some basicthings setup. Github has it's muck all set up with SSH and what not. I got nvm and rvm up and running. No jvm yet but we'll see if we even need it. 

Jekyll is being a but so I'm hoping this works on github when I push. It should I think... but we'll find out I suppose.

I'm writing this in VI which is super weird for me. I keep trying to use the arrow keys and VI really doesn't like it. Trying hard to break old habits even if only temporarily. 

Sure does get late quick...

Time to kick it soon.
