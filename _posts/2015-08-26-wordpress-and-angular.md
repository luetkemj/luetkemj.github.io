Benson is a small plugin I wrote while at VCUarts to make it super simple to consume wp-json endpoints with Angular. Here's a video of me attempting to explain how to use it.

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/fg90yk0UqXA' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<br/>
There's a ton of stuff that's assumed here as this isn't really a consumer plugin but geared much more directly at developers - specifically, lazy ones who just need to get simple access to scope and don't want to build a controller themselves.

Some links for things you would need ot get rolling.
