In this ever evolving quest that is scribe I am doing some initial exploration into [PixiJS](http://www.pixijs.com/). Itâ€™s a super fast 2d graphics rendering renderer. Itâ€™s also a completely different world for me and I know very littel about it. This has the potential to open a lot of doors. Just have to invest a bit of time into it first. A very long tutorial and docs await me on either a late night or early morning. Morning with coffee sounds much better ðŸŒ„â˜•ðŸ˜€

And look, a sprite!
