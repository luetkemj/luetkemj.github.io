2016 was a helluva year. New state, new baby, new jobs, new house, new cat... It's been exhausting, exhilarating, and terrifying. Some highlights:

* First full calendar year with the entire family in Austin, TX.
* Griffon and Bubbles both passed away.
* Squids joined the troupe leaving our total at 2 cats, 0 dogs, 0 fish.
* Frances enjoyed her first full calendar year of life and her first birthday.
* Remus has made a ton of new friends.
* Jeni went back to work and continues to homeschool.
* Our weekly DnD group has played more or less every week for the entire year.
* I officially became a front end engineer and learned how to write APIs, work with Mongodb, Express, React, Reduxâ€¦ basically Javascript on a professional level.
* I also ran two ultras this year, a high desert mountain 50k and a super flat 50 mile (my first).
