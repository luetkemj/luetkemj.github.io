First day at ALT Lab. Overwhelming! 

Not unexpectedly, but most definitely so. You should expect a big change when you leave a position you've nurtured for 5 years for something far more more unknown. 

In my 5 years at VCUarts I had the great honor of moving from a lowly student intern all the way to Associate Director of Web Development. But after 5 years I had gone around the horn. It was time to pass the torch as it had been passed to me.

At this point I have a pretty good idea of what I will doing at ALT Lab. How I will be doing these things is a bit more up in the air as everything is super off the cuff. When you work at the edge you have to accept some level of improvisation.

Time to get comfy, start breaking stuff, and remember that **change is good**.
