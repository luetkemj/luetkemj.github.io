Day 2: Follow your fear

It's interesting to be thoroughly in the fog again. For so long I had been completely at ease. As though my work had become easy. Really I had just stopped pushing myself. Burnt out. Never happy with my work but without having any reason to become so.

Now I feel that welcome unease again. Surrounded in a fog of question with the occassional pockets of understanding opening up. 

Row! The light houses are waiting!
