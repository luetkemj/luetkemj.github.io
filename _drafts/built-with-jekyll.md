This blog is built with [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

That may seem like an odd choice considering what I do for a living.

Wordpress is a dynamic database driven CMS with a proper admin. Setup is dead simple. Administration is smooth clean. Most hosts provide one click installs. Rampages here at VCU provides free blogs to anyone with a vcu email address.

Jekyll on the other hand has no database, is completely static, and has no admin. Setup requires terminal, administration can only be done in a text editor, and the best install option requires github and a working knowledge of git.

So why in the world am I using Jekyll?

I would argue that Jekyll is to the modern web development work flow as WordPress is to web publishing. WordPress lowers the barrier to publishing on the web. I work with people everyday who have no experience with wordpress or any web publishing platform for that matter and yet, with WordPress, can setup a website or blog and have full ownership of their past, current, and future content with minimal friction.

I believe that a motivated individual could get a site up and running with Jekyll without a background in web development with minimal friction. The primary barrier to web development is fear. Fear that you will somehow break your computer - or worse - **the internet**!

I can assure you, the Google will be just fine :)

Jekyll is to the modern web devlopment work flow as WordPress is the personal blog. They are both about as simple as it gets.

That's not too bad right? No HTML to learn (although you could use it if you want).
