It's tiny little town on the Big Thompson right between Estes Park and Loveland. I had been looking forward to this trip for some time. A great opportunity to run at elevation. A chance to get some serious vert on trails unlike anything I encounter here in the hill country of Texas.</p>\n<p>The day before I left I tweaked my back somehow. I haven't had back issues in years. Why my back decided to go out at this time I'll never know. It was a bit disappointing but probably forced me to be more hands with the kids than I would've otherwise wanted to be.</p>\n<p>The first day when my back was sore but not yet serious I went for a 7ish mile run in the mountains with 2800 feet of climbing. It was fantastic but left me wanting. I had to stop when I ran out of time for an outing scheduled with extended family. A mile and a half short of the summit with plenty of energy to go the distance I had to turn around.</p>\n<p>Despite the disappointment running that high on trails that equate to running on the edge of a cliff was exhilarating. Running back down was a whole new experience. Miles of technical downhill, I had not imagined! While I never hurt I certainly felt muscles I didn't know about before.</p>\n<p>Later we drove to 12000 feet in Rocky Mountain National Park. I could feel the blood rushing through my veins. My hands hummed with life. It was a small taste that left me wanting so much more, to move quickly at elevation...</p>\n<p>My opportunity to settle some unfinished business with the mountain came late last week. Unfortunately when I awoke I could hardly make it to the other side of the cabin let alone run 3500 feet up and down a mountain. The immature part of wanted to say \"fuck it\" and run anyways despite the spasms in my lower back. The dad in me couldn't rationalize risking my safety from a fall or just screwing my back up more. Thus I humbly declined to make the run. Responsibility sucks.</p>\n<p>Back home I am now recovering and getting itchy to go for a run. Something small and simple tonight.</p>\n<p>My Grindstone training went off the rails these last two weeks but if I've learned anything it's that I can't throw out the the race after a bad training week. I will have many of them. I made it past 40 miles two weeks ago and I had thought that was a huge long shot.</p>\n<p>One day at a time. Relentlessly ever forward.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"160627","title":"12,000 Feet","illustration":null,"layout":"post"}},"allFile":{"edges":[{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-191117-how-to-make-a-roguelike.png","publicURL":"/static/CA-191117-how-to-make-a-roguelike-8ac6b5eb72dc309e8ed002abc5babc91.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-191117-rltut.png","publicURL":"/static/CA-191117-rltut-ded16b0723e9b5d6e17f0cdaaa4f8f4f.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-191117-snerv.png","publicURL":"/static/CA-191117-snerv-653428e39f54328fd5fda9da4a58dc0d.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"forest-gump.jpg","publicURL":"/static/forest-gump-cb60a493d812bb1e574418382f053dce.jpg"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-190805-ball-bouncing.gif","publicURL":"/static/CA-190805-ball-bouncing-08773357003ecdc0ca6243769528e2c1.gif"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-190814-old-horse-thief.jpg","publicURL":"/static/CA-190814-old-horse-thief-bc1775f77b23d060fa622f87468886c1.jpg"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"luetkemj.png","publicURL":"/static/luetkemj-1831991e0e0c9cc03aa10eca078afa54.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"neistat.png","publicURL":"/static/neistat-ef667e42ff76189bfb9374db77d8a5f3.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-190805-PO5.png","publicURL":"/static/CA-190805-PO5-8f4d2c8fdad23dd34a37a5a78ead1ad1.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-190805-ball-spinning.gif","publicURL":"/static/CA-190805-ball-spinning-584cbc3260dd8d37d2dc4d57d4fe15ea.gif"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-190805-walks.gif","publicURL":"/static/CA-190805-walks-b81a25df3b9c73ec6bb0a083f0d940c2.gif"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-191117-snail2.png","publicURL":"/static/CA-191117-snail2-e0c8b4f93b470dd33861498f8d5c1b04.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-191117-snail.png","publicURL":"/static/CA-191117-snail-a46b03fed45b55d545309a400d9f0d10.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-190805-double-take.gif","publicURL":"/static/CA-190805-double-take-7c966447b035acc49491fbdcdb6a30b4.gif"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-190902-aglet.png","publicURL":"/static/CA-190902-aglet-95fc03afbf4429a0ca2ebba900ee8759.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-190722-cerebral-flab.png","publicURL":"/static/CA-190722-cerebral-flab-00a3862364464b2078d0f518fd91e8b9.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-191117-pcgdgns3.gif","publicURL":"/static/CA-191117-pcgdgns3-c9e6f7584599b5587a82d55e3cdc6c91.gif"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"unstuck1-6.jpg","publicURL":"/static/unstuck1-6-3d35c1d5b4e52f6f60b3a74cbe16dfc5.jpg"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"unstuck1-13.jpg","publicURL":"/static/unstuck1-13-9fce5365c83e38b7ba59ab5c89a17d0b.jpg"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"unstuck1-2.jpg","publicURL":"/static/unstuck1-2-c71a5d5130ff6ef004fb555dbde95f25.jpg"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"unstuck1-5.jpg","publicURL":"/static/unstuck1-5-ddd6f590be60c0392b239a7239f85e7e.jpg"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"unstuck1-1.jpg","publicURL":"/static/unstuck1-1-14e04cc27e2344d8ddcb96b06e6d7b82.jpg"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"unstuck1-12.jpg","publicURL":"/static/unstuck1-12-5d6578f2bb3cec3e1dce77a19a8b0b62.jpg"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"unstuck1-3.jpg","publicURL":"/static/unstuck1-3-3e0e741918140357ce0b1dc4ee32474d.jpg"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"unstuck1-4.jpg","publicURL":"/static/unstuck1-4-e5228d96a6abe34cdc2a91dbd108756b.jpg"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"unstuck1-7.jpeg","publicURL":"/static/unstuck1-7-573f1f8f23c2c9d3d727967095c038f5.jpeg"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"unstuck1-10.jpeg","publicURL":"/static/unstuck1-10-76b7e6142eeedafc69b4ad1e33f67bfa.jpeg"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"unstuck1-9.jpeg","publicURL":"/static/unstuck1-9-bbc2519a5acd4cc1c23915ae142ad501.jpeg"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"unstuck1-8.jpeg","publicURL":"/static/unstuck1-8-eecf5c4744d7323687815228a14f7933.jpeg"}}]},"nextPost":{"edges":[{"node":{"path":"/160516/module-exports"}}]},"nextPostMarkdown":{"frontmatter":{"title":"module.exports"}},"previousPost":{"edges":[{"node":{"path":"/161017/curry"}}]},"previousPostMarkdown":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Curry"}}},"pageContext":{"nextPostPath":"/160516/module-exports","previousPostPath":"/161017/curry"}}}
