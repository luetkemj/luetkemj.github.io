Iâ€™ve done plenty of this before but have never really kept purpose and inevitably just wiped whatever blog I had rolling. Always good to start fresh, yes?</p>\n<p>Without a clear goal every blogging venture I have ever embarked on eventually became yet another meandering examination of the self that no one in any clear state of mind would have any interest in at all. Iâ€™ll try and keep that to a minimum. ðŸ¤ž</p>\n<p>So whatâ€™s going to make this any different? Optimism! Idealism! Naivety! Itâ€™s kind of part of my job now!</p>\n<p>As I fall into place here at VCU Alt Lab Iâ€™ll be using this space to talk about what it is exactly I do here. Expect exhaustive posts on Wordpress development, clunky write-ups on programming techniques I have no business pretending to be an authority on, and meandering self examination with a slant towards the creative process. Also cartoons.</p>\n<p>Hope youâ€™ll find something of at least questionable value.
