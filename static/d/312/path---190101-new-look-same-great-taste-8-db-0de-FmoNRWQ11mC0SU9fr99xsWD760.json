I began this effort 8 months ago if my git history is to be believed.</p>\n<p>I don’t remember why things stalled. Probably just got busy. Last year was madness.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../../../images/forest-gump.jpg\" alt=\"that&#x27;s all I have to say about that\"></p>\n<p>I never really had any complaints about Jekyll. It worked fine and did exactly what it was supposed to do. But I don’t really know Ruby, templating was weird, I’m super comfortable in React, and I wanted to try out GraphQL. It only took a couple long weekends to figure out how everything worked and to build out a redesign. But then I stalled on SEO tweaks, some other low priority things, and new features that had no business holding up the effort. More of a mental block than anything physical.</p>\n<p>And here we are 8 months on. Deployed but not finished. If I kept waiting for that this thing would never see the light of day.</p>\n<p>2018 was a hard year with too many hard lessons. Whatever I have planned for my life this year is not what will happen. Things won’t be perfect in 2019. I won’t be perfect in 2019. There is nothing I can do to plan for all the curve balls life will throw my way. The best thing I can do is to be adaptable. I can take things across the finish line even if they aren’t \"finished”. I can make relentless forward progress towards… something.</p>\n<p>So begins yet another year in this thing called life.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"190101","title":"New Look, Same Great Taste!","illustration":null,"layout":"post"}},"allFile":{"edges":[{"node":{"relativePath":"luetkemj.png","publicURL":"/static/luetkemj-1831991e0e0c9cc03aa10eca078afa54.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"forest-gump.jpg","publicURL":"/static/forest-gump-cb60a493d812bb1e574418382f053dce.jpg"}}]},"nextPost":{"edges":[{"node":{"path":"/180505/netlify-lambdas-as-simple-as-possible"}}]},"nextPostMarkdown":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Netlify Lambdas - As Simple As Possible"}},"previousPost":null,"previousPostMarkdown":null},"pageContext":{"nextPostPath":"/180505/netlify-lambdas-as-simple-as-possible","previousPostPath":null}}
