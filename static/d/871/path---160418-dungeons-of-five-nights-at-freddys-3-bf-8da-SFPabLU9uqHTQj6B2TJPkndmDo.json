Normally this is something I would say no to. Instead I said yes since I’m trying to gain immortality through new experiences.</p>\n<p>I was watching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LyCC6jjcx8\">Vsauce</a> the other day and Michael was going on about how as we get older each new year is a smaller and smaller percentage of our lives. New experiences tend to stick in our minds better than the same old drudgery. So I’m giving this whole saying “Yes” thing a go.</p>\n<p>Enough preamble.</p>\n<p>Remus asked who I wanted to be. I said an electrician figuring I could do a number on the animatronics. He said there weren’t any electricians - which I find hard to believe with how many robots are in this game. I ended up going with a security guard position. Not what Rem was expecting me to pick apparently. Keeping the DM off guard!</p>\n<p>It turns out that I really didn’t have any weapons to fend off these robotic serial killers, just a flashlight and tablet. My only hope is to use a Freddy mask to trick them into leaving me alone. The problem there is the mask will shoot metal spikes into my head if I wear it for more than 15 seconds.</p>\n<p>I tried to pull apart whatever electronics I could find.  Maybe create some sort of crude taser to short circuit these psychopaths. Unfortunately there weren’t enough spare parts in the office to build anything.</p>\n<p>A few close calls with Chicka and Freddy later I try to call 911. The phone is dead and I am extremely upset with my employers who pay me a measly $150 dollars a week to risk my life guarding this horror show. Why? I don’t even know. The animatronics seem to do a fine job themselves. They could certainly handle some thief in the night.</p>\n<p>Amazingly I manage to survive the night. It’ll take some convincing to get back to work the next day. $150 is not nearly enough. What is that, $30/night? This gig is sub minimum wage!!</p>\n<p>Offering my neck to a bunch of bloodthirsty man eating animatronics hardly seems an appropriate path to immortality.</p>\n<p>Can’t wait for tomorrow!</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"160418","title":"Dungeons of Five Nights at Freddy's","illustration":"http://i.imgur.com/b84yvgr.gif","layout":"post"}},"allFile":{"edges":[{"node":{"relativePath":"forest-gump.jpg","publicURL":"/static/forest-gump-cb60a493d812bb1e574418382f053dce.jpg"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"luetkemj.png","publicURL":"/static/luetkemj-1831991e0e0c9cc03aa10eca078afa54.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"neistat.png","publicURL":"/static/neistat-ef667e42ff76189bfb9374db77d8a5f3.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-190805-PO5.png","publicURL":"/static/CA-190805-PO5-8f4d2c8fdad23dd34a37a5a78ead1ad1.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-190805-ball-spinning.gif","publicURL":"/static/CA-190805-ball-spinning-584cbc3260dd8d37d2dc4d57d4fe15ea.gif"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-190805-ball-bouncing.gif","publicURL":"/static/CA-190805-ball-bouncing-08773357003ecdc0ca6243769528e2c1.gif"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-190805-double-take.gif","publicURL":"/static/CA-190805-double-take-7c966447b035acc49491fbdcdb6a30b4.gif"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-190805-walks.gif","publicURL":"/static/CA-190805-walks-b81a25df3b9c73ec6bb0a083f0d940c2.gif"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-190722-cerebral-flab.png","publicURL":"/static/CA-190722-cerebral-flab-00a3862364464b2078d0f518fd91e8b9.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-190814-old-horse-thief.jpg","publicURL":"/static/CA-190814-old-horse-thief-bc1775f77b23d060fa622f87468886c1.jpg"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-190902-aglet.png","publicURL":"/static/CA-190902-aglet-95fc03afbf4429a0ca2ebba900ee8759.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-191117-how-to-make-a-roguelike.png","publicURL":"/static/CA-191117-how-to-make-a-roguelike-8ac6b5eb72dc309e8ed002abc5babc91.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-191117-rltut.png","publicURL":"/static/CA-191117-rltut-ded16b0723e9b5d6e17f0cdaaa4f8f4f.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-191117-snerv.png","publicURL":"/static/CA-191117-snerv-653428e39f54328fd5fda9da4a58dc0d.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-191117-snail2.png","publicURL":"/static/CA-191117-snail2-e0c8b4f93b470dd33861498f8d5c1b04.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-191117-snail.png","publicURL":"/static/CA-191117-snail-a46b03fed45b55d545309a400d9f0d10.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-191117-pcgdgns.gif","publicURL":"/static/CA-191117-pcgdgns-c9e6f7584599b5587a82d55e3cdc6c91.gif"}}]},"nextPost":{"edges":[{"node":{"path":"/160418/net-creator"}}]},"nextPostMarkdown":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Net Creator"}},"previousPost":{"edges":[{"node":{"path":"/160419/random-potion-effects-table"}}]},"previousPostMarkdown":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Random Potion Effects Table"}}},"pageContext":{"nextPostPath":"/160418/net-creator","previousPostPath":"/160419/random-potion-effects-table"}}
