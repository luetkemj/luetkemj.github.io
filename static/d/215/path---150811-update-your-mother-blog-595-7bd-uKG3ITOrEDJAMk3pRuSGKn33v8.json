In the signup form we create a list of blogs to choose from based on sites from the network a the current user has accounts on. If we just list all blogs a user is part of we'll get everything - even other motherblogs.</p>\n<p>Having students signup up motherblogs to eachother is a potential cross pollination disaster. </p>\n<p>As of v1.2 the dropdown list will only show sites for which a user is admin. This filters all other mother blogs and for most students will keep the the list to just their own blog.</p>\n<p>So if you are using the Mother Blog plugin on a network install, now would be a good time to update.</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Update the Mother Blog plugin to avoid catastrophic cross pollinization. üêùüêùüêùüêù</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"150811","title":"Update Your Mother Blog","illustration":null,"layout":"post"}},"allFile":{"edges":[{"node":{"relativePath":"forest-gump.jpg","publicURL":"/static/forest-gump-cb60a493d812bb1e574418382f053dce.jpg"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"ball-bouncing.gif","publicURL":"/static/ball-bouncing-08773357003ecdc0ca6243769528e2c1.gif"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"luetkemj.png","publicURL":"/static/luetkemj-1831991e0e0c9cc03aa10eca078afa54.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"neistat.png","publicURL":"/static/neistat-ef667e42ff76189bfb9374db77d8a5f3.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"walks.gif","publicURL":"/static/walks-b81a25df3b9c73ec6bb0a083f0d940c2.gif"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"ball-spinning.gif","publicURL":"/static/ball-spinning-584cbc3260dd8d37d2dc4d57d4fe15ea.gif"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"cerebral-flab.png","publicURL":"/static/cerebral-flab-00a3862364464b2078d0f518fd91e8b9.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"double-take.gif","publicURL":"/static/double-take-7c966447b035acc49491fbdcdb6a30b4.gif"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-190805-PO5.png","publicURL":"/static/CA-190805-PO5-8f4d2c8fdad23dd34a37a5a78ead1ad1.png"}}]},"nextPost":{"edges":[{"node":{"path":"/150728/mother-blogs-made-better"}}]},"nextPostMarkdown":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Mother Blogs Made Better"}},"previousPost":{"edges":[{"node":{"path":"/150825/vvcreate"}}]},"previousPostMarkdown":{"frontmatter":{"title":"VV Create"}}},"pageContext":{"nextPostPath":"/150728/mother-blogs-made-better","previousPostPath":"/150825/vvcreate"}}
