I began this effort 8 months ago if my git history is to be believed.</p>\n<p>I don’t remember why things stalled. Probably just got busy. Last year was madness.</p>\n<p>I never really had any complaints about Jekyll. It worked fine and did exactly what it was supposed to do. But I don’t really know Ruby, templating was weird, I’m super comfortable in React, and I wanted to try out GraphQL. </p>\n<p>It only took a couple weekends to figure out how everything worked and to build out a redesign. But then I stalled on SEO tweaks, some other low priority things, and new features that had no business holding up the effort. More of a mental block than anything physical.</p>\n<p>And here we are 8 months on. Deployed but not finished. If I kept waiting to be done this thing would never see the light of day. What is \"done\" anyways?</p>\n<p>2018 was a hard year with too many hard lessons. Whatever I have planned for my life this year is not what will happen. Things won’t be perfect in 2019. I won’t be perfect in 2019. There is nothing I can do to plan for all the curve balls life will throw my way. The best thing I can do is to be adaptable. I can take things across the finish line even if they aren’t \"finished”. I can make relentless forward progress towards… something.</p>\n<p>So begins yet another year in this thing called life.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/cb60a493d812bb1e574418382f053dce/37b21/forest-gump.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 345px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 95.3623188405797%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"that's all I have to say about that\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/cb60a493d812bb1e574418382f053dce/37b21/forest-gump.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/cb60a493d812bb1e574418382f053dce/aa9d8/forest-gump.jpg 148w,\n/static/cb60a493d812bb1e574418382f053dce/92f47/forest-gump.jpg 295w,\n/static/cb60a493d812bb1e574418382f053dce/37b21/forest-gump.jpg 345w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"190101","title":"New Look, Same Great Taste!","illustration":null,"layout":"post"}},"allFile":{"edges":[{"node":{"relativePath":"luetkemj.png","publicURL":"/static/luetkemj-1831991e0e0c9cc03aa10eca078afa54.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"forest-gump.jpg","publicURL":"/static/forest-gump-cb60a493d812bb1e574418382f053dce.jpg"}}]},"nextPost":{"edges":[{"node":{"path":"/180505/netlify-lambdas-as-simple-as-possible"}}]},"nextPostMarkdown":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Netlify Lambdas - As Simple As Possible"}},"previousPost":null,"previousPostMarkdown":null},"pageContext":{"nextPostPath":"/180505/netlify-lambdas-as-simple-as-possible","previousPostPath":null}}
