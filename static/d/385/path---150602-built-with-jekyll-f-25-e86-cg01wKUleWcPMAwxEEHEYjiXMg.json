Setup is dead simple. Administration is smooth and clean. Most hosts provide one click installs. <a href=\"http://rampages.us\">Rampages</a> here at VCU provides free blogs to anyone with a vcu email address.</p>\n<p>Jekyll on the other hand has no database, is completely static, and has no admin. Setup requires terminal, administration can only be done in a text editor, and the best install option requires github and a working knowledge of git.</p>\n<p>So why in the world am I using Jekyll?</p>\n<p>I would argue that Jekyll is to modern web development as WordPress is to web publishing. WordPress lowers the barrier to publishing on the web. I work with people everyday who have no experience with wordpress or any web publishing platform for that matter and yet, with WordPress, can setup a website or blog and have full ownership of their past, current, and future content with minimal friction.</p>\n<p>I believe that a motivated individual could also get a site up and running with Jekyll without a background in web development with minimal friction. The primary barrier to web development is fear. Fear that you will somehow break your computer - or worse - <strong>the internet</strong>!</p>\n<p>I can assure you, the Google will be just fine :)</p>\n<p>Let's dive head first into some serious workflows and see how not that hard it really is.</p>\n<div class=\"meta\" markdown=\"1\">\n<h4>Next Up:</h4>\n<p>We'll create a new site with Jekyll and examine all the individual steps and rabbit holes along the way.</p>\n<h3>In this series</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/150602/built-with-jekyll/\">Built With Jekyll</a><br/>\n<a href=\"/150616/built-with-jekyll-part2/\">Built With Jekyll Part 2</a></p>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"date":"150602","title":"Built with Jekyll","illustration":"/assets/posts/built-with-jekyll/octocat.png","layout":"post"}},"allFile":{"edges":[{"node":{"relativePath":"forest-gump.jpg","publicURL":"/static/forest-gump-cb60a493d812bb1e574418382f053dce.jpg"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"luetkemj.png","publicURL":"/static/luetkemj-1831991e0e0c9cc03aa10eca078afa54.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"neistat.png","publicURL":"/static/neistat-ef667e42ff76189bfb9374db77d8a5f3.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-190805-PO5.png","publicURL":"/static/CA-190805-PO5-8f4d2c8fdad23dd34a37a5a78ead1ad1.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-190805-ball-spinning.gif","publicURL":"/static/CA-190805-ball-spinning-584cbc3260dd8d37d2dc4d57d4fe15ea.gif"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-190805-ball-bouncing.gif","publicURL":"/static/CA-190805-ball-bouncing-08773357003ecdc0ca6243769528e2c1.gif"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-190805-double-take.gif","publicURL":"/static/CA-190805-double-take-7c966447b035acc49491fbdcdb6a30b4.gif"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-190805-walks.gif","publicURL":"/static/CA-190805-walks-b81a25df3b9c73ec6bb0a083f0d940c2.gif"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-190722-cerebral-flab.png","publicURL":"/static/CA-190722-cerebral-flab-00a3862364464b2078d0f518fd91e8b9.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-190814-old-horse-thief.jpg","publicURL":"/static/CA-190814-old-horse-thief-bc1775f77b23d060fa622f87468886c1.jpg"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-190902-aglet.png","publicURL":"/static/CA-190902-aglet-95fc03afbf4429a0ca2ebba900ee8759.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-191117-snerv.png","publicURL":"/static/CA-191117-snerv-653428e39f54328fd5fda9da4a58dc0d.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-191117-how-to-make-a-roguelike.png","publicURL":"/static/CA-191117-how-to-make-a-roguelike-8ac6b5eb72dc309e8ed002abc5babc91.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-191117-snail.png","publicURL":"/static/CA-191117-snail-a46b03fed45b55d545309a400d9f0d10.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-191117-rltut.png","publicURL":"/static/CA-191117-rltut-ded16b0723e9b5d6e17f0cdaaa4f8f4f.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-191117-snail2.png","publicURL":"/static/CA-191117-snail2-e0c8b4f93b470dd33861498f8d5c1b04.png"}},{"node":{"relativePath":"CA-191117-pcgdgns.gif","publicURL":"/static/CA-191117-pcgdgns-c9e6f7584599b5587a82d55e3cdc6c91.gif"}}]},"nextPost":{"edges":[{"node":{"path":"/150528/simple-signups"}}]},"nextPostMarkdown":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Simple Signups"}},"previousPost":{"edges":[{"node":{"path":"/150605/my-web-dev-setup"}}]},"previousPostMarkdown":{"frontmatter":{"title":"My Web Dev Tool Kit"}}},"pageContext":{"nextPostPath":"/150528/simple-signups","previousPostPath":"/150605/my-web-dev-setup"}}
