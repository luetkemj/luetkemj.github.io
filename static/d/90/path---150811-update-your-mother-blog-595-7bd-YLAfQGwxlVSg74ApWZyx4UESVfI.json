In the signup form we create a list of blogs to choose from based on sites from the network a the current user has accounts on. If we just list all blogs a user is part of we'll get everything - even other motherblogs.</p>\n<p>Having students signup up motherblogs to eachother is a potential cross pollination disaster. </p>\n<p>As of v1.2 the dropdown list will only show sites for which a user is admin. This filters all other mother blogs and for most students will keep the the list to just their own blog.</p>\n<p>So if you are using the Mother Blog plugin on a network install, now would be a good time to update.</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Update the Mother Blog plugin to avoid catastrophic cross pollinization. üêùüêùüêùüêù</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"150811","title":"Update Your Mother Blog","illustration":null,"layout":"post"}},"allFile":{"edges":[{"node":{"relativePath":"luetkemj.png","publicURL":"/luetkemj.website/static/luetkemj-1831991e0e0c9cc03aa10eca078afa54.png"}}]},"nextPost":{"edges":[{"node":{"path":"/150728/mother-blogs-made-better"}}]},"nextPostMarkdown":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Mother Blogs Made Better"}},"previousPost":{"edges":[{"node":{"path":"/150825/vvcreate"}}]},"previousPostMarkdown":{"frontmatter":{"title":"VV Create"}}},"pageContext":{"nextPostPath":"/150728/mother-blogs-made-better","previousPostPath":"/150825/vvcreate"}}
