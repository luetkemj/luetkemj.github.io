<p>[one who does not read]</p><p>It was the end of 2022 when I decided to try and read more. It wasn't long before I noticed an unexpected trickle of water flowing down a dry river bed. A long winter was coming to an end. An unexpected spring thaw quickly turned into what felt like a hundred year flood.</p><p>I felt more creative energy than I had in years. I hadn't been that productive in over a decade. It was all so easy.</p><p>Until it wasn't.</p><p>I was so focused on the product, I had lost all sight of the practice. To make more time to make more stuff I read less and less. The river slowed down and eventually dried up. There I stood, on the banks of a dusty river bed, as baffled about the current state of affairs as I was about how it had ever gotten going in the first place.</p><p>Its clear now, having started reading again, how fundamental it is to the practice. It doesn't take much to get the river flowing. But it does take a steady stream of input.</p><p>Some recommendations from my own summer reading:</p><ul><li><p>Make It Till You Make It - Brendan Leonard</p></li><li><p>The Witches - Roald Dahl</p></li><li><p>This Is Water - David Foster Wallace</p></li><li><p>Ducks - Kate Beaton</p></li><li><p>Atomic! - Henry Kuttner</p></li></ul>
