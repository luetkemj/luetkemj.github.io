<p>There was a time before the internet when not knowing was just a fact of life. Curiosities would surface and die unsatisfied. Facts had to be memorized or written down and all those little notes had to be organized for later recall. It was error prone,  frustrating, and cumbersome. </p><p>And yet there seems to be something lost with the convenience of our modern connectivity. </p><p>We live in a time where curiosity is short lived. The instant a query surfaces there is an answer. The skill of memorizing phone numbers is long since irrelevant. The mulling of ideas in our minds while resting our heads on a pillow in the dark is a thing of the past.</p><p>Ideas are no longer mulled quietly in our imperfect consciences. They are researched endlessly on an infinitely connected super brain. We don't trench new pathways in our brains but instead scroll through well worn algorithmically smoothed canals of the hive mind.

There’s be more to know about shrines and I want to know it. I want to find one in my own woods or even make one and leave it for others to find. </p><p>But what exactly are they made of? What do they look like? Are they meant to worship someone or something? Do they have to?</p><p>I found myself at the precipice of a rabbit hole echoing that sweet siren’s song from the depths below. The internet has all the answers. This curiosity could be settled between spoonfuls of chocolate frosted sugar bombs. Satisfaction is after all just a few taps away…</p><p>But wait, what if I don’t seek answers from the oracle? What if I exist for a while longer in this state of not knowing? There was a time before the internet when not knowing was just a fact of life. Curiosities could surface and die unsatisfied.

There are libraries and book stores nearby. We have museums and even actual shrines.</p><p>Will venturing down a rabbit hole in the real world yield different results? Is there a shrine at the end of this pilgrimage or something different?</p>
