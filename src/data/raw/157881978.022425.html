<p>Greetings paid subscriber! Your continued support in light of the fact that it has, so far, been offered up for nothing in return is greatly appreciated. Your commitment to whatever it is that I’m doing here has quite literally provided the encouragement to keep it going. I have been thinking about how to provide something extra for some time in exchange for your support. </p><p>As an experiment, I’m going to begin sharing the daily journals, daily. The weekly digest will still go out on Thursdays but as a paid subscriber you will receive them early, likely with additional rambling and context that will not be available in the regular weekly newsletter.</p><p>This means you will be getting a lot more emails. Which wasn’t part of the deal and may or may not be to your liking. If the extra email bothers you, please let me know. Feel free to leave a comment or just reply the email - I read all of it.</p><p>Anyhoo - thanks for subscribing. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aZaL!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a587107-c59a-4095-8fb3-6e375cdd8cea_1500x2000.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aZaL!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a587107-c59a-4095-8fb3-6e375cdd8cea_1500x2000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aZaL!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a587107-c59a-4095-8fb3-6e375cdd8cea_1500x2000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aZaL!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a587107-c59a-4095-8fb3-6e375cdd8cea_1500x2000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aZaL!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a587107-c59a-4095-8fb3-6e375cdd8cea_1500x2000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8a587107-c59a-4095-8fb3-6e375cdd8cea_1500x2000.jpeg" width="1456" height="1941" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8a587107-c59a-4095-8fb3-6e375cdd8cea_1500x2000.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1941,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:491171,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://dophs.substack.com/i/157881978?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a587107-c59a-4095-8fb3-6e375cdd8cea_1500x2000.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aZaL!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a587107-c59a-4095-8fb3-6e375cdd8cea_1500x2000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aZaL!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a587107-c59a-4095-8fb3-6e375cdd8cea_1500x2000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aZaL!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a587107-c59a-4095-8fb3-6e375cdd8cea_1500x2000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aZaL!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a587107-c59a-4095-8fb3-6e375cdd8cea_1500x2000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The weather really has taken a turn for Spring!
