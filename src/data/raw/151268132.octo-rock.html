<p>Speaking of ultras a local runner finally completed Octo Rock this weekend. I’ve mentioned the Quad Rock 50 before, a 50 mile race between Lory State Park and Horsetooth. <s>The 50 route goes by Arthur’s and Horsetooth Rock 2 times each.</s> Octorock is the full Quadrock course twice with the added difficulty of actually tagging the summits of Horsetooth and Arthur’s each time. 8 rocks. Octorock. It’s long 100 miler with over 22,000 feet of vert. Many have tried. Only one has succeeded. </p>
