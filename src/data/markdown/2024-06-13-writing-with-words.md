I’ve been listening to _[The Essential Guide To Writing a Novel](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/essential-guide-to-writing-a-novel/id1612967885)_ podcast by Jim Thayer. It does a really good job of explaining fundamental techniques that I sometimes recognize but don’t at all understand.

In other news, we went camping this weekend. It was a lot of fun! we tried dispersed camping for the first time and it was way better (and easier) than expected.

Please enjoy this cartoon about the experience.
