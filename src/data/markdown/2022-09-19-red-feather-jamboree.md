# intro

I moved to Fort Collins in May of this year. Running in the mountains, while not
the only reason for the move, was definitely a primary motivator. After taking 4
months off starting with an injury in early February it was time to get back at it. The move was done and I could no longer use it as an excuse.

> I'm pushing 40 and have lived at or near sea level my whole life. A combination
> of being out of shape, older than I've ever been, at elevation, and climbing
> more each week than I had previously gotten in a month has been extremely humbling.

# training

My training since moving to CO has been consistantly minimal. On average I've run about 13 miles a week.
I've done some cross training with family hikes, mountain biking, and just tooling around town.
In short - it's been ok. Enough to get to the finish line but not enough to race
or expect any sort of spectactular day.

> racing. I would respect my training or lack there of and listen to my body.

> Yeah. Ok. I've heard that refrain before.

> after about 4 months
> off from running. I blew a hamstring in february and spent the rest of the time
> planning and executing a cross country move.

# packet pick pickup

The start line near Red Feather Lakes is about an hour from my house so I could have left the
morning of. I've been itching to try out my camper shell on the
truck so instead I packed up the day before and headed out after work. I'm still
getting used to how beautiful it is out here. Maybe 20 minutes or so across and
out of town and suddenly I'm surrounded by huge skies, vaulted ridges, and a
sneaking suspicion I took a wrong turn and ended up in Wyoming.

I made it to the Scout Ranch shortly before sunset. There was a volunteer at the
gate waiting to greet me who asked if I had registered for camping. I told him I
was hoping to just park overnight and would sleep in the back of the truck. He
told me where I could find overnight parking (which I promptly forgot) and sent
me on my way.

The dirt road to the mess hall for packet pickup is steep. I don't think I would have
made it in the Prius. Thankful to have the truck so I don't have to worry about
getting stuck. When it came to parking, definitely missed the Prius. I got it
done but it wasn't pretty.

Packet pickup was mostly uneventful. They found my name right away and handed
me my race swag and bib. It wasn't until I asked for directions to the camper lot that things
got awkward. Being new here I was hoping to just park overnight and
crash in the back of the truck. Stealth camping is a thing right? Well, I guess
you're supposed to be stealthy about it.

The volunteer asked me to wait to talk to the RD about my camping situation but
he was in a long conversation with another runner. Being the introvert I am, I
decided to just leave the ranch without talking to anyone and find some public
lands nearby.

I got in the truck and made my way to the front gate only to find it locked. I
had not considered they would close the gate after dark... I drove around for a
bit looking for somewhere quiet to park the truck and ended up settling in next
to another racer who had parked at the startline. Not very stealthy I know, but
we were quickly joined by at least one other car camper. Strength in numbers
right? Well, apart from stressing about an awkward conversation with the RD that
never happened, I slept great.

The startline began to get busy around 5am and shortly after I saw a line of
vehicles heading to a proper parking lot. I got in line and followed suit. Time
for some truck coffee, breakfast, and a relaxed wait until race start at 8am.

# The race

The half marathon started an hour after the 50k at about 7500 feet. This was the low point of the course. It would be all uphill (and downhill) from
here for a total change of about 1800 feet.

The first two miles to the Elkhorn aid station consisted of a super smooth dirt
road and the first few hundred feet of climbing. My plan going into the race was to take
it easy, hike the climbs, run the flats and downs, have a good day, and DON'T
BLOW UP.

I ran through the first aid station without stopping. At just 2 miles in and only
11 left there wasn't much of a point. I may not have hiked any of the inital
climbs like I planned, but I was definitely taking it easy. 

So far so good.

The next four to five miles contained the bulk of the elevation for the
remainder of the race. I knew that if I could keep it under control until we
made it over the hump I could push it on the back half. The climbs
weren't intense, but they were climbs. On the first hike I was passed by a few
runners chewing up the climbs with a steady gait only to bomb past them on the
downs. We played leapfrog for the next hour until about mile 7.

Topping out at about 8500 feet it was finally time to head back down. I offered
final trail greetings to some familar faces I had been trading places with and
happily opened up my stride for some sustained downhill running.

The trail dropped about 500 feet over the next 2 miles to Lady Moon aid at mile 8.5.
It was there that I tagged a gate, refilled my water bottles and turned around
to execute the only out and back on the course.

The next mile and half included yet another climb, nothing major at this point I
was really hoping for more sustained descents. Mile 11 was just what I was
looking for! 300+ feet of smooth downhill single track! My first and only sub 8
minute mile of the day. I passed a few more folks here and settled in for what I
thought would be smooth cruise to the finish line at the bottom of a big hill.




After refilling my water bottles (with the help of some very kind volunteers) I
turned around for a little bit of backtracking.
