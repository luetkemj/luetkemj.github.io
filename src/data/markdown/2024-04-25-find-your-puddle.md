Hello! How was your week? What’s the weather been like?

It’s spring here (mostly) and it’s been beautiful (mostly). I feel like it’s been a good week - although I can’t quite put my finger on what was so good about it. Just a generally positive vibe. Maybe it’s just the spring in the air.

I stumbled on a daily comic substack by that I’ve been enjoying. The author sends out daily single panel comics with a few thoughts on the day and a poem.

It inspired me to try some easy “slice of life” comics as a way to get back into the swing of things.

I’ve thought way too much about the cartoon version of myself. The face I use as a sort of logo is well over 10 years old at this point. Sometimes I shave in real life and wonder if it’s ok that my caricature always has a full beard. When I put on weight I wonder if my avatar should as well.

I think it’s ok. To not look exactly like my avatar. I’m not drawing “For Better Or Worse” here.

But I’m probably not gonna stop thinking about it.

Yeah. These sorts of “small” projects are never that small are they? Thankfully we haven’t had to take out the toilet yet, but I’m not ready to rule it out either.

Skulltooth on the other hand… I’ve started over from scratch with a new game engine. It’s going quickly - basically just a giant refactor - but the original engine I wrote couldn’t really handle saving in the way it needed to without a rewrite. Say hello to [Skulltooth 2 - Forcecrusher](https://luetkemj.github.io/forcecrusher/)!

As a note, these names have absolutely nothing to do with the gameplay. Skulltooth Forcecrusher was a halfling barbarian from an old D&D campaign I played my son. We killed a dragon. Just saying.

On the way home from a run I saw a duck standing in a very small puddle in the middle of the road. This duck had no intention of moving and I didn’t ask him to. I don’t know why but the image has stuck with me.

I hope you find your puddle someday too.

The routines are back (mostly). I’ve been trying to get up early again so I can write in the journal and work in the spirit box. It’s all about balance and balance can be hard to find sometimes. I’ve been getting up at 4am and then going back to sleep around 6am for a nap before I have to really start my day. Not sure how balanced that is but it’s better than just going into a deep sleep deficit.

Find your creative time!

[Quad Rock](https://gnarrunners.com/quad-rock-50/) is a touch over 2 weeks away. I think I’m ready but also a bit nervous. Hoping for some cooler weather on the day. Not quite close enough to get a hint of the conditions from the 10 day forecast…
