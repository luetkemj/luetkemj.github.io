This past weekend I went on a 3.5 hour long run. Three times up and down Horsetooth Rock. The first hour I thought of many things.

“How long do I actually want to be out today?”

“Do I have enough water?"

“I’d rather be doing that other thing.”

“I _**should**_ be doing that other thing.”

But then, after an hour or so, I leave the place where one thinks about what it is they’re doing and begin to enter a new place. A place where time and miles become meaningless.

There is water. What was that other thing? There is no other thing.

An instant eternal.

Exactly where I want to be. Both lost and found.
