We spent a lovely weekend in Walden, CO. There’s nothing in Walden. Most folks go the extra hour to Steamboat Springs. We just needed to get away and Walden has plenty of that. So we stayed there and it was fantastic.

While away, I did very little of the typical routine. It was nice! But it came with the cost of having to get back into it on the other side.

Showing up is important. Even if you have to phone it in. Sometimes it’s just about digging that groove.

Eventually I turned to a rote outline of process. Some folks had asked and it felt like maybe it would be easier to write about.

It wasn’t.

Every time I write about this particular aspect of my process I feel a bit crazy. People tend to stare like they just discovered my murder wall. It’s makes sense to me - but not really to anyone else. I get it.

Eventually, after having spent enough mental energy sorting through it, this zine popped out. I guess that was point all along. Getting over the hump. Falling back into the groove.

Finally, and just in time, that old familiar spot along the river.

Every time I try to write about the spirit box I feel like a crazy person. In a nutshell, it helps make sense of all the journals and notes I keep. I put thoughts and ideas into it and new stuff comes out of it. Let me know in the comments if you’re interested in hearing more and we can chat about it.

Thanks for reading, sorry if this one’s a bit off - still trying to find that rhythm. It’s a bit of a process.
