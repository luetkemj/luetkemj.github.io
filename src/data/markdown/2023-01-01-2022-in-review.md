I keep track of my runs in [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/3639309) and in a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kcfr6YipK2IQmuGSeFlGb_L4YiGrGncuWHJGGpSxbFU/edit?usp=sharing). Every run brings back a little memory. A snapshot from the trail, a smell, or a feeling. And each run, as I dredge it up from the memory banks, pulls with it the surrounding events in my life. So here's 2022 as punctuated by runs - and a whole lot of other shit.
