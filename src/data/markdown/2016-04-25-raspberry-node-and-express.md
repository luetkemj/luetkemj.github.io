Spent some time this weekend looking at node and express docs. Why the light seems to have finally
turned on I don't know. I'm looking forward to actually building a backend with no plans to design
something visual at the moment.

I can design and implement but focusing my effort to the server at the moment is really exciting.
Maybe that was the cork I needed to pull.

I can do many things. But I can only do one thing at a time.
