If anyone out there is actually using the Mother Blog plugin I wrote recently for VCU ALT Lab - you should update it with the [newest version](https://github.com/vcualtlab/motherblog).

FeedWordPress requires that subscribed users have an account on the mother blog. In the signup form we create a list of blogs to choose from based on sites from the network a the current user has accounts on. If we just list all blogs a user is part of we'll get everything - even other motherblogs.

Having students signup up motherblogs to eachother is a potential cross pollination disaster. 

As of v1.2 the dropdown list will only show sites for which a user is admin. This filters all other mother blogs and for most students will keep the the list to just their own blog.

So if you are using the Mother Blog plugin on a network install, now would be a good time to update.

**TL;DR** Update the Mother Blog plugin to avoid catastrophic cross pollinization. 🐝🐝🐝🐝
