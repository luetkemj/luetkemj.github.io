I have finally migrated from Jekyll to Gatsby. I began this effort 8 months ago if my git history is to be believed.

I don’t remember why things stalled. Probably just got busy. Last year was madness.

I never really had any complaints about Jekyll. It worked fine and did exactly what it was supposed to do. But I don’t really know Ruby, templating was weird, I’m super comfortable in React, and I wanted to try out GraphQL. 

It only took a couple weekends to figure out how everything worked and to build out a redesign. But then I stalled on SEO tweaks, some other low priority things, and new features that had no business holding up the effort. More of a mental block than anything physical.

And here we are 8 months on. Deployed but not finished. If I kept waiting to be done this thing would never see the light of day. What is "done" anyways?

2018 was a hard year with too many hard lessons. Whatever I have planned for my life this year is not what will happen. Things won’t be perfect in 2019. I won’t be perfect in 2019. There is nothing I can do to plan for all the curve balls life will throw my way. The best thing I can do is to be adaptable. I can take things across the finish line even if they aren’t "finished". I can make relentless forward progress towards… something.

So begins yet another year in this thing called life.
