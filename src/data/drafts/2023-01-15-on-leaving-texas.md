My horse is tied to leaving Texas. 

That's what I'm supposed to be writing about anyways. Why we left Texas. To be completely honest I don't really want to. The problem is I already wrote about that. It was pretty great actually. I don't normally have much if any confidence in what I'm writing but I can say with all honesty that I'm pretty sure it was great. If nothing else it was good exercise even if no one will ever be able to read it.

I wrote it in Neovim while I was reworking my configuration. Believe it or not, out of the box, Neovim does not have autosaving. My 2022 recap started as the timeline it ended up being, but at lease as I was initially writing it, felt like it was missing some context. So I wrote a bit about what prompted the move to Colorado. 

In the end, the bit about why we left Austin felt like it's own peace. So I split it off into it's file that I failed to save. Cause I'm an idiot. This same thing happened to me with vim a few months ago. So I added auto saving there as well. Just didn't learn my lesson apparently.

So why did we leave Texas? It had a bit to do with the pandemic, and bit to do with dying inside, and little bit more to do with how Texas was never the sort of place we had ever intended to live. The pandemic just highlighted some of our existing problems with both Texas and ourselves. It more or less lead to a mental breakdown and a resulting 6 months hiatus from work. The silver lining of it all being that the break allowed us time to step back and observe our lives. Accept that we desperately needed a fundamental change and the time and space to enact that change.

So we left Texas.

You might think living in a place like Austin would be ideal duting the pandemic. But instead life transformed into some sort of religion where we tithed in virtue signalling and sacrificed our neighbors on the altar of nuance.

Depending on your politics you might think living in a place like Austin would be ideal during the pandemic. Very liberal, everyone wearing masks and doing their best to actually follow CDC guidlines. Unfortunately life instead transformed into some sort of virtue signal based religion where we tithed in useless beeps for essential workers and sacrificed our neighbors on the alter of nuance. Everyone regardless of what 'side' they were on turned into the worst version of themselves.

It was exhausting at best and traumatizing at worse. Add to that the seemingly spiteful dictates made in the governor's office in direct opposition to the decisions made by local officials in Austin. I thought one of the central tenants of conservatism was ...

Look. We had some personal issues that needed to be sorted out. Texas didn't help with that. Trying to keep up with the Joneses didn't help with that. The pandemic certainly didn't help with that. The snowpocolypse of '21 just showed exactly how alone we were in Texas. The state expects you to be ok with letting big business run rough shod over everything sans any sort of redulations. All of your problems can be resolved by the community. What do you do if you don't have community in Texas? Fuck you that's what ...

Oof. I'm rambling again and getting worked up about Texas again. It really is time I just let it go. I am so much happier here. No need to focus on what we left. But instead on where on we're going. 

Time to snag another tooth. 

Adios amigos. I don't miss you.
