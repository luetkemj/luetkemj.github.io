2022 was a lot.

The catalyst for everything that follows was the snowpocalypse of '21.

In the fall of 2020 we finally managed to diagnose and fix our septic system. It had been giving us guffins for 2 years at that point. In hilariously unfortunate timing, our main sewer line broke a week later.

What I thought was a was simply a backed up toilet quickly turned into that scene from ET with plastic lining the walls and ventilators evverywhere. Such is the way of water damage mitigation.

The next few months months were spent in a revolving door of rentals as contractors of all colors and stripes had their way with our home. When we were allowed back multiple rooms were either off limits or unrecognizable. Several vertical feet of drywall was removed from every affected room. The lack of insulation was visibly apparent - but I guess that's just how things are done in Texas.

It was shortly after everything was finally put back together that the storm began to brew. j

Sewer problems in 20 that lead up to the storm. Realixing how bad it could be.

losing faith in Texas.
The lack of regulations.
The crasy times -

You might think living in a place like Austin would be ideal duting the pandemic. But instead life transformed into some sort of religion where we tithed in virtue signalling and sacrificed our neighbors on the altar of nuance.

autosave should be working again...

We moved to Texas in 2015 for work. It was never intended to be a forever move. Rather a waypoint on our way to Colorado.

The catalyst for everything that follows was the snowpocolypse of '21.

We had just managed to finally diagnose and fix our septic system. It had been giving us guffins since we bought the place 2 years earlier. And in hilarious timing, the main sewer line broke and flooded several rooms immediately after. We spent the next few months in a revolving door of rentals as contractors of all stripes and colors had their way with our home.

By early February we finally had things mostly back to normal. Just in time it seemed for an unprecedented winter storm. Being from the north we always found the bread and milk runs in southern states to be a bit silly. This time though, things felt a bit different. Jen had the foresight to pick up one of the last generators available just in case. We had no idea how important that last minute purchase would turn our to be.

In the end we had lost power for a week. Our water was out for even longer. The generator had managed to keep our internet going along with a small space heater in the master bedroom where the 4 of us, 2 cats, and 2 german shepherds all huddled together for warmth. Following along with the chaos from our phones we didn't just lose water and power that week. We lost every bit of faith we had in the state of Texas.
