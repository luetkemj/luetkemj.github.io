To write a thing.

I am attempting to write a thing. I am attempting to write a thing with a new
tool. Why am I writing a thing. Where is this thing going to go. Why am I
using a new tool do it.

## What is the new tool.

Vim. Vim is the new tool.

What am I writing.

I am writing a blog post about writing a thing.

Why am I doing any of it.

I am in a creative desert. I have been for years. I know around about when I
entered it. And I have a general idea why I wandered off into it. One part
exhaustion. Two parts personal injury and loss. 

I've been wandering for a while now. 

I'm probably not doing this for you. I'm definitely not doing this because of
you. I'm also not exactly doing this for me. Or at least not entirely. 

I'm doing thing because of Miss Bean. She was light that burned too hot and too
fast for this world. And during he

I'm writing this thing for Miss Bean. I used to sing for Miss Bean. I still do,
but I used to too. Sometimes she would even sing with me. My family tried endlessy to catch me singing for her. 
And I refused to let them. My son caught me once and I deleted the video. 

I don't know why I did that. Anyone who knows me knows I sing to animals, and
myself, all the flipping time. I'm sure at the start it was due to embarassment
but in the end it had become some sort of foolishly shortsighted game. 

Bean was only with us for a year. And I found that we didn't have enough
pictures or videos of her. The few that we had brought great comfort. But there
were hardly any of her and I together. And there were exactly 0 videos of me
singing to her.

It's something I regret. And I hope that I will leave enough remnants of myself
so that those who care about me will have something to greive with. Or to
remember me by. Or to put in a box in the attic for someone to discover years
later. Or to forget about. Not because they didn't have anything to remember me
by, but because they had the choice. The choice to forget. 

No one has to read this. I can't imagine anyone will. 

That's ok. 

It's in the universe. 

The choice to remember me or forget is there for others to make. 

I won't make that choice for you.

I've been in a creative desert for years now. I can pinpoint the moment I
stepped foot in it. I have a general idea when I started getting close to it.
Looking back, the path to this wasteland seems so obvious.

The way out, that's still very ambiguous. 



I had a dog. Her name was Bean. And she taught me some things.

I used to sing for Miss Bean. I still do, but I used to too. Sometimes she
would sing with me. Usually she just sat and listened. My family made a game of
trying to catch me singing to her. And I foolishly made a game of preventing
them. 

One day my son managed to get a video of it. I deleted it.

I don't know why I did that. Anyone who's spent any real time with me knows I sing
to animals, myself, the universe. 

Bean was a light that burned too bright for this world. She died after being
with us for just over a year. And when she left, I didn't have any videos of me
singing to her. Or her with me. In fact I really didn't have enough pictures
or videos of her at all.

To be fair, I don't know what would have been enough. That first night, I
wanted Bean back. A million full color videos wouldn't have been enough. But I
do know that I will forever regret deleting that video of me singing to Bean.

The last few years - gosh, it's definitely been more than a few - I've been in
a creative desert. I lost my why. I've felt that my life and my experience
wasn't really worth telling. Am I too mundane? Too unhappy? Too priviledged? 

Whatever the reason, losing Miss Bean da Ween taught me some things. 

Leaving a record of yourself isn't about you. It's about your loved ones.
It gives them the choice in how they decide to mourn you. It let's them
decide how to remember you - or forget you.

Miss Bean da Ween, beaniest bean you nare done seen was the queen of FOMO. She
had to be in on everything, everywhere, all at once. And in the end she got her
way. We chose to plant sunflowers to remember this Bean. And this Bean, this beaniest
of bead da weens, she gave us an explosion of sunflowers unlike anything the
world had ever seen. There were articles written that offered up one
scientific reason or another for the sudden proliferation of sunflowers. But we
knew. It was her. She finally got to do all the things.

Miss Bean didn't get to choose to take more photos of herself. She had no
mechanism to leave us a greater record of her short time on this earth. I made
that choice for her and I will always regret it. 

But Bean, in her great wisdom, left us a forest of perennial sunflowers to
remember her by. I will forever be grateful to her for that.

Bean taught me to leave a stronger evidence of my time on this earth. I will
leave a pool of artifacts for those I love. It will be up to them to decide if
they want to dive deep or bury it.
I don't have to right make that
choice for them. It's not up to me. 

I owe it to them to take photos and write
nonsense, and sing stupid songs to the universe on record.

Who's that bean that bean da ween, beaniest bean you nare done seen that bean,
just bean, all bean, who bean?

I'm bean!
