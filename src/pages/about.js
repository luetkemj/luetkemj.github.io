    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Mark Luetke and I live in Austin Texas with my wife and two kids. We live with two cats, Joan Marie Butt and Squid Leroy Bun. We enjoy beautiful summer days in the park and camping under the stars.</p>
    <p>Professionally, I’ve worked fast food, cafeteria food, and gas station food. I’ve worked on a pig farm, a cow farm, and a dog farm. I’ve laid brick and cut stone. I’ve replaced auto glass, cleaned carpets, cared for the mentally ill, and studied for the ministry.</p>
    <p>Previously I was the Associate Director of Web Development at VCUarts where I made websites with ♥ and at ALT Lab where I facilitated change.</p>
    <p>Currently I work for Cognitive Scale where I engineer front ends, mostly with javascript.</p>
    <p>You can see some of my work on <OutboundLink href="https://github.com/luetkemj">github</OutboundLink>.</p>
