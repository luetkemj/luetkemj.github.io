Hello! My name is Mark Luetke and I live in the woods outside of Richmond, Virginia with my wife and son. We have a very hairy dog, several cats, and a couple fish. We enjoy beautiful summer days in the park and camping under the stars.

Professionally, I’ve worked fast food, cafeteria food, and gas station food. I’ve worked on a pig farm, a cow farm, and a dog farm. I’ve laid brick and cut stone. I’ve replaced auto glass, cleaned carpets, cared for the mentally ill, and studied for the ministry.

Previously I was the Associate Director of Web Development at VCUarts where I made websites with ♥.

Currently I work at ALT Lab where I facilitate change.
